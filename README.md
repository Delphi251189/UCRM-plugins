# UCRM-plugins

Plugins are open-source programs that extend the functionality of [UCRM](https://ucrm.ubnt.com/). These plugins will enable your UCRM to import payments, integrate with another accounting software, cooperate with 3rd party HW and tools, etc.

## How does it work?
* Find the plugin you need and download its ZIP archive.
* Upload the ZIP archive in UCRM (System > Plugins).
* You can configure additional settings.
* And that's it, let UCRM run the plugin repeatedly or click to execute it on demand.

## How can I contribute?
* These plugins are under MIT license enabling anyone to contribute any upgrades to existing plugins or create whole new ones.
* Propose any Pull Request in this repository.
* See the documentation below.


## Developer documentation
Developer documentation for creating UCRM plugins can be found in [`docs/index.md`](docs/index.md)
