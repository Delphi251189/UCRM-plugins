# UCRM-plugins

Plugins are open-source programs that extend the functionality of [UCRM](https://ucrm.ubnt.com/). These plugins will enable your UCRM to import payments, integrate with another accounting software, cooperate with 3rd party HW and tools, etc.

UCRM plugins are compatible with UCRM v. 2.10.0-beta1 and higher.

## How does it work?
* [Find the plugin](https://github.com/Ubiquiti-App/UCRM-plugins/tree/master/plugins) you need and download its ZIP archive.
* Upload the ZIP archive in UCRM (System > Plugins).
* Then, enable the plugin and configure its settings.
* That's it, let UCRM run the plugin repeatedly or click to execute it on demand.
